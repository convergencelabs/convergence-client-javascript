# Contributing to the Convergence JavaScript Client

First, thanks for your interests in contributing to Convergence. We strive to build a strong and open community focused on making Convergence the best real time collaboration framework.

Here are some important resources:
  * [Convergence Community Forum](https://forum.convergence.io) ask questions or tell us what your working on!
  * [The Convergence Road Map](https://convergence.io/roadmap) provides a high-level view of where we are headed.
  * [The Convergence Project](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-project) is the centralized project for issue reporting.
  

## Testing
Please help us out by writing tests, if possible for your new functionality.  Make sure all current tests pass by running `npm run test` before committing.

## Submitting changes
Please create a [GitHub Pull Request](pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We use [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to lint our code. you can run `npm run lint` to lint the code before submitting.

Thanks,
Convergence Labs, Inc.
